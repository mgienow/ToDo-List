# ToDo-List
Because I am learning to build things with JS and this is what you do. I hope no puppies are harmed in the making of this to do list app.

Saving each iteration of the version sections, because so many developments and changes are made, and then wiped out. I want to be able to refer back to earlier code so as to figure out how we got from point A to point WTFAmI?
